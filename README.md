# PACT Act

>In an unexpected move, 41 Republican senators last week blocked what was seemingly a bipartisan bill expanding health care benefits for veterans exposed to toxic burn pits last Wednesday. The bill, named the PACT Act, is designed to provide health care benefits for veterans who were exposed to burn pits during deployment â€“ open-air trash sites that disposed of military waste through burning. - [USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/04/20/pact-act-veterans-burn-pits-exposed-open-air-trash-sites/)
